<p>
Your fitness website is where you introduce yourself, your certifications and your specialty.
 It’s also where you convey the values of your business, 
 highlight your offerings and show off your physical space if you have one.<br>

 

But a fitness website can be so much more than a resume or a 
visual hub that represents your brand. In fact,<br> the best fitness websites double as business tools, 
helping you manage your class schedule, bookings and payments, while engaging with clients and fostering a sense of community.<br>

It sounds like a lot, but trust us, that’s a good thing. If you need some inspo to get started, 
check out the best fitness websites built with Wix. Each website is unique to the specialization it supports, but 
they all have one thing in common: successfully managing a fitness business.<br>
