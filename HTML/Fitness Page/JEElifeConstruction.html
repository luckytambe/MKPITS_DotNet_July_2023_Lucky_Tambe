	<p><span>S</span>ome construction projects are small renovations or repair jobs, like repainting or fixing leaks,
	where the owner may act as designer, paymaster and laborer for the entire project. However, 
	more complex or ambitious projects usually require additional multi-disciplinary expertise and manpower, 
	so the owner may commission one or more specialist businesses to undertake detailed planning, design,
	<br>
	construction and handover of the work. Often the owner will appoint one business to oversee the project 
	(this may be a designer, a contractor, a construction manager, or other advisors); such specialists are normally appointed for their
	
	<br>
	expertise in project delivery and construction management and will help the owner define the project brief, agree on a budget and schedule,
	liaise with relevant public authorities, and procure the services of other specialists (the supply chain, comprising subcontractors).
	<br>
	Contracts are agreed for the delivery of services by all businesses, alongside other detailed plans aimed at ensuring legal, timely, 
	on-budget and safe delivery of the specified works.

Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound
 and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use. 
 The financial structure must be adequate to build the design provided and must pay amounts that are legally owed
 . Legal structures integrate design with other activities and enforce financial and other construction processes.
